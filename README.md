# YoutubeChatBot
Ever watched a YouTube tutorial and wished you could just ask, “When did they mention transformers?” I built a chatbot that answers your questions using the video’s transcript! 🎥💬 Built with LangChain, GPT-3.5, FAISS &amp; Streamlit. Supports any URL with captions, even auto-generated! DM me to try the demo!
